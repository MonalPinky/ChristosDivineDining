    >I can highly recommend Christo's food with the utmost confidence. I have
    had the privilege to eat (and see) it on more than one occasion and have
    always been very impressed. Not only does it always look beautiful and
    extremely appetizing, it tastes divine! He is an excellent chef, with an
    extensive knowledge of a very wide variety of cuisines and cooking styles.
    Anything from gourmet dishes to hearty homemade meals is cooked with love
    and passion. His attention to detail is remarkable. I also had the blessing
    of him handling the catering for my late husband's funeral (on a tight
    budget) and it exceeded all my wildest expectations. The food was excellent
    and everything was handled with great care and compassion. It was laid out
    beautifully and perfectly on time.</span
